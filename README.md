# Bioinformatics Project: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying conserved regions in protein sequences using **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**. It includes:
- Introduction to MSA
- Tools like Clustal Omega, MAFFT, MUSCLE
- Step-by-step workflow using UniProt and BLAST
- Phylogenetic analysis of insulin sequences across primates
- Applications and conclusions

## 🧬 Objective
To align homologous insulin protein sequences from various primate species and analyze evolutionary conserved regions.
